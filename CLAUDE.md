# LIVING SUPERWEAPON — project notes for Claude

Isometric top-down superhero action game (Three.js). Inspiration: **Bid For Power × Soldat**.
The **engine is the product** — a data-driven power system. Demo-first, offline, no build gymnastics.

## Run / verify
- `npm run dev` → http://localhost:5180 (vite, port pinned in `.claude/launch.json`).
- Headless smoke test (no display needed): load the page, then in the console/Playwright:
  `window.LSW` exposes `{ game, hud, ROSTER }`. `game.startMatch(id)`, `game.spawnRival(id)`,
  step with `game.update(dt)`. To pose a still frame, override `game.update = () => game.world.render()`
  (freezes decay), set the camera manually, then screenshot. Give a bot `new AI(player)` +
  `game.controlPlayer = dt => game.controlBot(game.player, dt)` to watch AI-vs-AI live.
- ⚠️ Vite may do a one-time full reload when it optimizes deps (three postprocessing / dynamic imports).
  If a posed screenshot shows the title screen again, the page reloaded — just recompose and re-shoot.

## Architecture (see README for the full map)
- **Sound design** (`core/audio.js`): combat SFX take an optional world `pos` — gain falls off with
  distance to `audio.listen(x,z)` (set to the player each frame); booms carry ~240u, cracks ~110u,
  screams ~190u. **DBZ voice synths**: `yell(pitch,dur,intensity,pos)` (detuned saws + vibrato + breath),
  `grunt` (pain bark on slams), `cry` (KO wail — fires for every death in `handleKO`). `game.heroYell(f,i)`
  gates on `def.yells` + `f._yellCd`; fires on charge start, long-charge (>1.15s), transforms/buffs,
  tier-ups (`_yellCd` reset for the ascension scream), haymakers. `def.voicePitch` 0.55 (RAGE) – 1.3 (DECIBEL).
- **The tabletop layer** (`data/ranks.js`, baked per-fighter as `f.sheet` in the ctor): seven attributes
  (Fighting/Agility/Might/Vigor/Intellect/Awareness/Resolve) on a named 10-rank ladder (Civilian→Cosmic),
  DERIVED from hero data with `def.attrs` overrides; talents (1–3 per hero, `HERO_TALENTS` + kit-derived
  fallback) bake to flat multipliers: `cdMult` (pay() + items), `jabMult` (melee.js), `spreadMult`
  (rifle/volley), `blastMult` (Projectile ctor + mines), `evadeCdMult`, `ccRecover` (stagger/frozen
  decrement), `healMult`, `odWindow` (Overdrive threshold), `sumDurMult`, `chargeRate`, `predator`,
  `kiRegenMult`, `visMult` (fog range). Character select renders the full sheet (ranks/talents/gear).
- **ORIGIN — the character creator** (`data/creator.js` rulebook + `engine/creatorUI.js` screen; "FORGE
  NEW" card on the roster; ruled name-TBD, so renaming = one string): D&D point-buy over the ranks.js
  sheet. Budgets STREET 160 → COSMIC 400 (+UNBOUND); escalating `ATTR_COST` on the rank ladder — attrs
  literally derive hp/ki/speed/strength (`derived()`); a ~40-power catalog of ENGINE-PROVEN ability
  configs (costs calibrated by BALANCE.md: martial priced up, charge kits down, gear cheap); traits,
  gifts, talents, gadgets, frames (`def.build` overrides BUILDS), palettes (no purple)/skin/voice.
  LIVE damage numbers per pick (`powerNumbers`) + auto LeFevre threat (`threatOf(points)`) — both
  creator-interview rulings. Persists `{picks,def}` in localStorage `threshold_customs_v1`;
  `installCustoms(ROSTER)` at boot makes customs full citizens (playable, rivals, survival waves, P2)
  with AI doctrine derived from the kit (`deriveAI`). Sheet hooks: `def.talents`/`def.attrs`/`def.build`.
  `validate()` gates saves (budget, LMB+RMB required, ults R-only, quiver-needs-bow). SAVE & TEST drops
  straight into training. `LSW.creator` + `LSW.runSlot` exposed for headless testing.
- **Gadgets** (items on X, `charges` per life, refilled on respawn): beacon · medkit · flashbang
  (staggers + wipes bot memory) · jetcell (temp flightTier 3) · shieldpack (`f._shieldHp` ablative pool
  in takeDamage). Bots use all of them (`controlBot` items block).
- **New powers**: `mine` (plant ≤3 proximity charges — meshes swept in `dispose()`), `lifedrain`
  (held siphon → self-heal), `boomerang` projectile flag (out-clip-return, hits both passes; bounces
  home off walls/ground). Balance: `docs/BALANCE.md` — AI-vs-AI audit method + first-pass rulings
  (martial rushers trimmed, TITAN/VEGA/PYRE buffed; Threat-Low gear humans losing to Very-High is BY RULING).
- `data/characters.js` — the **52** heroes as **pure data**. Add a hero = add data here. Trait fields:
  `thorns` (hurt grabbers), `phase` (intangible), `grabHeal`, `teleEscape` (auto), `metal` (robot),
  `guardStrong` (riot shield), `tentacles` (verlet tentacles), **`strength` 1–10** (melee dmg up,
  knockback/beam-shove down via `kbMul`, faster ice break-outs), **`overdrive`** (comeback: drained/low-ki
  melee hits convert damage→ki in `game.onHit`), **`threat`** (LeFevre scale, shown on select),
  **`guardType`** `'block'|'deflect'|'barrier'`, **`meleeTiers`** 2|3, `frostResist` (fire heroes).
- `engine/abilities.js` — `TYPES` registry (20 power types incl. `tentacle`, `portal`, `rifle`, `bow`,
  `quiver`). New *kind* of power = one entry.
- **Charged melee** (`melee.js chargeStart/chargeUpdate/chargeRelease/_heavy`): V tap = jab combo ·
  short hold = straight (meleeTiers 3 only) · ≥0.55s = HAYMAKER (dmg scales with charge × strength).
  **Haymaker vs guard = GUARD CRUSH** (blocker staggers 0.85s, −0.55 meter, wide open); jabs/straights
  blocked = attacker punishable (strikeCd 0.5 + hitstop). AI winds up haymakers via `f._aiCharge`.
- **Guard types**: visible `guardArc` mesh on every figure (flash on block, reddens near break).
  `deflect` (VANGUARD/TITAN): projectiles/arrows bounce back at the shooter (Projectile `_defl`).
  `barrier` (AURUM/RIME): blocks ALL directions, costs 16 ki/s (out-drains regen), breaks at 0 ki.
- **Freeze** (`addFrost/_thaw`): cold cones build `frost` → encased in ice (`frozenT`, shell mesh,
  no actions; control fns gate on `frozenT > 0`). Strength shortens it; `frostResist` halves buildup;
  teleEscape heroes blink out for 20 ki; heavy hits shatter early for 1.3× damage. Immune 2.5s after.
- **DoTs** (`addDot`): poison/burn/gas stacks tick hp with tinted particles + periodic numbers (arrow
  payloads, KIVULI's gas). **Bow/quiver**: draw-scaled arrows (REAL arrow meshes, not orbs) with
  payloads poison/flame/explosive cycled by `quiver` (kit-widget chip shows what's nocked).
- **Grass** (`world._buildGrass`): ONE InstancedMesh, 2400 blades, vertex-shader wind; every crater/
  scorch calls `flattenGrass` (blades in radius go down); `resetTerrain` restores. Keep it one draw call.
- Guard binds: **C / X / Mouse4-5** (kbm) or L1 (pad). Docs: `docs/ROSTER.md` (equivalents + LeFevre
  threat scale), `docs/VOICE_AND_SFX.md`, `docs/ENGINE_ROADMAP.md` (the 20-item plan), `docs/DESIGN_INTERVIEW.md`.
- **Slam damage** (`entity._slam` + `game.onSlam`): being HURLED into cover walls / arena border / the ground
  hurts (≤32, credited to the launcher via `lastHitBy`). Gated on `launchT` (set by takeDamage when kb>30 or
  launch>12) — dashing/flying into walls yourself NEVER hurts. `_slamCd` debounces. Throws + tentacles +
  fist-slams all feed it.
- **Tentacles** (`engine/tentacles.js`): verlet chains (9 segs, tapered spheres) in WORLD space — fighters with
  `def.tentacles` build them lazily and MUST be `dispose()`d (all entity-clear paths call `e.dispose()`).
  Idle = noise sway; `t.target = vec3` = reach. KRAKEN's `tentacle` ability: reach → hold (drag victim in,
  `grabbedBy` stun, teleEscape at midpoint) → hurl at the nearest cover block → slam physics does the crunch.
- **Portals** (`game.placePortal/updatePortals`, type `portal`): press 1 = orange door at aim, press 2 = blue exit;
  fighters + projectiles within 5u hop through (`_portalCd` 0.9s). One pair per owner; cleared on match start.
- **Power tiers** (`entity.tierOf`: lvl 1–3=I, 4–6=II, 7–9=III, 10=MAX): crossing a tier = transformation
  ceremony (shockwave + lightning + pillar + slowmo + "TIER II" announce), aura shifts accent→gold→white-hot
  (`TIER_COLORS`), and the HUD meter panel physically WIDENS (+44px/tier) so a maxed meter LOOKS bigger.
- **Will Fist grab-slam** (`summons.js`): triggering the fist with a foe under it seizes → hoists → pile-drives
  (guaranteed ground slam). Constructs release victims on dispose.
- Arena is **240** (`world.ARENA`, instance-mirrored for the radar) with 20 cover blocks (= fog shader MAX).
- `engine/melee.js` — `MeleeSystem`: Strike/Guard/Grab trifecta. Called from `controlPlayer`/`controlBot`
  (keys V/G/C) and per-frame via `melee.update(f,dt)` inside `Fighter.update`.
- `engine/game.js` — orchestrator + combat helpers + **`onHit(target,amount,opts,blocked)`** (every hit
  routes through here → damage numbers, combo, sparks) + soft lock-on (`pickTarget`, `updateReticle`).
- Player and AI both emit an **intent** `{move, aimDir, slots:{key:{pressed,held,released}}, fly}`
  routed through the same `runSlot`. Keep that symmetry.
- Controls: WASD move · mouse aim (**hover a character to target it**, else nearest-to-cursor) · LMB/RMB/Q/E/**H**/R
  powers (the 4th power slot is `f` in data but bound to **KeyH**) · **F = FLIGHT TOGGLE** (mode on/off;
  SPACE rise, release hover, CTRL descend; SPACE rising-edge still auto-takes-off) · **V tap jab / hold
  HAYMAKER · G grab · C/X/Mouse4-5 guard** · SHIFT dash · **2×TAP move = EVADE** · ESC pause · 1–0 swap · TAB roster · B rival.
- **Flight tiers** (`def.flightTier`): 0 = grounded (SARGE/GALE — leap only, toggle refuses) · 1 = clumsy
  (VOLT/HIVE/KRAKEN — sags when not rising, sine drift, no hover) · 2 = levitator (0.62× air speed —
  RIME/WARDEN/PYRE/RIFT/TITAN/KIVULI) · 3 = full flight. `flyStyle`: 'fire' = Torch wake (TORCH/PYRE),
  'ice' = RIME rides a frozen board (mesh in `parts.iceBoard`). `energyInfinite` (TITAN): ki pinned at max,
  spendKi always true, HUD shows "∞ CORE", **tier hard-capped at II** in levelUp — the DBZ-android tradeoff.
- **Flight POSE** (`_animate`, figure group order **'YXZ'** — yaw→pitch→roll along the facing axis; do NOT
  revert to default XYZ, it turns the lean into a sideways roll): body aligns with the TRAVEL direction —
  level cruise = prone head-first (~87°), rising = vertical (head points where you're going), pure up/down
  and hover-at-altitude = fully upright, dives = nose-down (capped 1.85 rad), strafes bank (`rollT` from
  lateral velocity). Engagement scales with speed (`k` ramps 6→26 u/s) so drift/hover stays vertical.
  **Superhero limbs**: prone cruise = lead fist punched past the head (armR −2.95) + off arm swept back,
  legs trail only when prone (`fp × prone`); hover = arms flared, legs hanging straight. Combat poses win
  (`combatPose` gate). Archers get a draw pose (`_bowDraw` ← `_bowDrawT` from the bow ability).
- **Weapons registry** (`entity.js buildWeapon`): pistol/shotgun/rifle/sword/knife/spear/axe/bow meshes,
  mounted on fists via BUILDS `weaponL:/weaponR:` (or legacy `gun`) — SARGE sword+rifle+shield, GALE bow+knife.
  All along the arm's −Y axis so poses + ragdoll carry them.
- **ITEMS** (`def.items` on the hero, runtime `f.items`, button **X** — guard is C/Mouse4-5 only now):
  gadgets a character CARRIES, outside the ability slots — no ki, cooldown-only. `game.useItem(f)`
  dispatches by kind. First kind `beacon` (SANDRA): X plants a tripod at her feet, X again — from
  anywhere — teleports her back to it (state ready→deployed→cooldown; mesh disposed via `f.dispose()`;
  AI plants when healthy + bails to it when hurt; radar shows a gold diamond; kit-widget chip shows state).
- **Reveal buff** (`def.reveal` on a buff → `f._revealT`): `_humanSees` returns true while active —
  SANDRA's "The Ring Sees" wallhack (Its Voice reads every camera).
- **THE MARLETTA** (`facebomb` type + Projectile `face/armDelay`): charge grows her (size/damage/blast by
  charge), release → slow homing canvas-face sprite; ANY contact (foe/ground/cover/timeout) → `_arm()`:
  she stops, trembles, blushes toward burning for `armDelay` (0.65s), then detonates with double shockwave
  + lightning + slowmo. Deflect guards can't bounce her. KING STEFANOS (`stefanos`, COF canon) carries her on R.
- **Ragdoll weight** (`ragdoll.js`): `gravMul` from strength (heavies fall harder); first hard core impact
  (chest/pelvis/head, >~30 u/s) fires `game.onRagdollImpact` → strength-scaled crater + dust + shake
  (STR ≥ 7 lands like a meteor). One impact per ragdoll (`_impacted`).
- **PURPLE EXCEPTION**: KIVULI ONLY (creator override 2026-07-22). No other purple anywhere, ever.
- Design docs: `docs/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md` (creator interview rulings — READ before big design calls),
  `docs/CODEX.md` (power schema), `docs/NEXT_CHARACTERS.md` (COF canon import queue: Stefanos/Sandra/…).
- **Evade** (`def.evade = {kind,...}` on each hero, defaults in `abilities.js → EVADE_DEFAULTS`, engine `performEvade`):
  kinds `dash` / `blink` / `sprint` / `slide` (RIME ice-skate, low drag) / `phase` (SPECTER, long i-frames). Double-tap
  detection lives in `controlPlayer` (`TAP_DIRS`, 0.28s window); bots juke incoming projectiles with it in `controlBot`.
  ⚠️ dash/slide impulses need `burstT`/`_slideT` — `Fighter.move()` clamps velocity to walk speed otherwise.
- **Energy clarity** (don't regress): running ki dry mid-ability is NEVER silent. `game.onDrained(f)` (smoke fizzle +
  power-down + `drainedT` → HUD DRAINED tag + red-pulsing ki bar) fires from beams/charges/cones/volleys/phase/spirit-bomb;
  a charge that runs dry **releases at current charge** (never a frozen orb). `game.onNoKi(f,key)` (unaffordable press)
  → `hud.kiDenied` slot shake + ki-bar flash. Ki bar: amber <38%, red pulse <15%.
- **Flight / levitation** (`entity._physics`): `flyHeld` rising-edge takes off into `this.flying` (gravity suspended).
  While flying: hold `flyHeld` → rise (`FLY_RISE`), `descendHeld` → sink (`FLY_SINK`), neither → **hover** at altitude
  with a gentle bob. Releasing rise clamps the upward coast so you settle where you let go. Descending onto the ground
  (or a block top, if `descendHeld`) exits flight = lands. `grounded` = `!flying`. Player descend = Ctrl/Z, pad L3.
  AI descends by setting `descendHeld = flying && !it.fly`. Knockback still arcs under gravity (flight is opt-in only).
- **Gamepad** (`core/gamepad.js`, `game.pad`): standard/PS2 mapping — sticks move/aim, R2/L2 powers, □○ melee,
  L1 guard, ✕ fly, △ ult, dpad Q/E/F + swap, Start/Select pause/roster. Polled at top of `game.update`;
  `controlPlayer` ORs pad + keyboard/mouse; Start/Select/swap handled in `main.js padSystem()`.
- **Physics**: AABB (Box3) collision vs cover in `entity._physics` — walls push out (least-penetration axis) and you
  **stand on block tops** (`onBlock` → `grounded`); `game.resolveBodies()` separates overlapping fighters.
  Cover carries `{x,z,hx,hz,top}` (construct walls fall back to `r`/`h`).

## Hard rules (do not break)
- **Beams are hoses, not lasers** — a traveling tip drags the beam (`projectiles.js → BeamHose`).
  Never make a beam instant/hitscan.
- **Charge = scale** — hold longer ⇒ bigger orb + more damage + wider blast + harder ground
  shockwave & lightning (`abilities.js → charge`, `vfx.js → shockwave/lightning`).
- **NO PURPLE** anywhere (UI, VFX, characters). Warm-neutral dark + gold/amber; per-hero non-purple accents.
- Pooled `PointLight`s come from `vfx.borrowLight()`/`returnLight()` — never `scene.add()` them again
  (double-add duplicates them in the children array).
- Shared temp vectors `_v/_v2` in `projectiles.js` alias — don't hold a reference across a loop that reuses them.

## Trifecta rules (don't break)
- **Strike beats Grab beats Guard beats Strike.** Guard blocks frontal strikes to ~12% chip (unblockable
  grabs ignore it); getting hit cancels your own grab start-up; back-grabs are unescapable + hit harder.
- Guarding slows you and doubles as a ki-charge stance. `guardMeter` breaks → 0.7s stagger.
- Variants live on the def: `thorns`, `phase`, `grabHeal`, `teleEscape`. Keep the escape a FRONT-grab only.

## Presentation
- **Roster screen** (`hud.buildTitle` + exported `heroStats(def)` + `describeAbility`): per-hero stat bars
  (Power/Range/Mobility/Defense/Health/Energy, derived 0–10), trait tags, full ability list with generated
  descriptions; roster cards show HP·PWR·SPD. Same screen serves title + in-match TAB.
- **Violent hits**: `vfx.impact(pos,dir,{color,power})` = comic impact-star (`impactStar`, canvas sprite) + spray +
  ring + shake. Strikes/heavy-melee/throws freeze BOTH fighters (`hitstop`), `game.slowmo(dur,mul)` on finishers,
  `hud.flashScreen(color,dur)` white pop, `audio.impact(power)` thud+crack. Blocked hits get a small blue star only.

## Modes, progression & local multiplayer
- **Modes** (`MODE_IMPL` in `game.js`, metadata in `data/modes.js`): duel / survival / rumble / training, each with
  `setup/tick/onKO/isOver/hud`. `game.startMode(id, {p1,p2,twoPlayer})` clears + spawns humans + calls setup. `update`
  runs `mode.tick`, checks `mode.isOver` → `endMatch(result)` → `hud.showEndScreen` (Rematch→re-enter cfg, Menu→title).
  `game._lastCfg` holds the last config for rematch. Survival wave enemies get `noRespawn` (entity `_remove` → spliced).
- **Progression**: fighters have `level/xp/xpNext/levelMult/score/kills/streak/lastHitBy`. `handleKO` (in the KO detection)
  attributes the kill via `lastHitBy` (<4s), scores + streaks, `grantXp`→`levelUp` (levelMult folds into `powerBuff`;
  cap 10). `onHit` grants XP for damage. `announceKill` → First Blood / multi-KO / streak titles via `hud.announce`.
- **Players**: `game.humans = [{fighter, scheme:'kbm'|'pad'}]`; `game.player` = humans[0]. `controlPlayer` (P1 kbm; ignores
  pad when 2 humans via `NULL_PAD`), `controlPad` (P2). `followHumans` fits both (`world.setBaseZoom`). Vision unions humans
  (`_humanSees`, fog shader gained `uP2/uHas2` for a 2nd reveal bubble). **LAN-ready** via this abstraction; netcode = TODO.
- **HUD**: `updateModeBar` (per mode.hud type), `updateKitWidget` (per-hero chips: drones/constructs/phase/buff/beam/…),
  level badge + XP bar, `announce`, `scorePopup`, `showEndScreen`. Title = mode cards + 1P/2P + P1/P2 char select.

## Destructible environment (GeoMod-lite)
- **Ground craters**: ground is a subdivided `PlaneGeometry(_,_,112,112)`; `world.crater(cx,cz,r,depth)` displaces verts
  (local +z → world +y) into a bowl+rim, accumulates into `_gh`, **clamped [-6.5, 1.4]** (the "limit"), then
  `computeVertexNormals`. ⚠️ recompute is the cost — **gated to big hits only** (`worldImpact`: power≥1.25 || radius≥14),
  so per-projectile impacts don't recompute. ~0.39ms/frame with it live.
- **Destructible blocks**: each cover has `hp/maxHp` + a `crack` overlay mesh (`_crackTexture`, opacity = damage).
  `game.damageBlock(c,amt,pos)` → cracks + dust; at 0 → `shatterBlock` (debris chunks tween, dust, scorch, mini-crater,
  block sinks & hides). `world.removeBlockFromCover` splices from `cover` (kept in `coverAll`) + `refreshFogBoxes` so
  collision/LOS/vision/fog all drop it. Sources: `areaDamage`→`worldImpact` (all explosions), knockback-into-wall in
  `entity._physics` (spd>34 cracks it + bounce), sustained beams chip the blocked cover, beam-clash `_overpower`.
- **Reset**: `world.resetTerrain()` (restore all `coverAll`, flatten `_gh`) + `vfx.clearScorches()` in `startMatch`.
  Shattered meshes are hidden, NOT disposed, so reset restores them.

## Field of vision (fog of war)
- **Shader fog** (`world._buildFogOfWar` / `updateFog`): a ground plane whose fragment shader darkens outside a vision
  cone (`uDir`,`uCos`,`uRange`) + near bubble (`uNear`), with **per-fragment wall occlusion** (cover boxes passed as
  `uBoxC/uBoxH` uniforms, 2D segment-AABB `segBox`). Follows `player.aim`. `setFogEnabled` off in menus.
- **Player vision** (`game.updateVision`, params `visNear/visRange/visCos/visReveal`): each enemy's `_vis` lerps to
  visible?1:0 (cone+range+`canSee` LOS, OR near radius, OR `_bright` reveal-on-attack). `obj.visible` cutoff at 0.35.
  Transitions: `_revealFx` ring on appear, `_lastKnown` (fading ghost + red "?" sprite) on disappear.
- **Integration**: `pickTarget` skips foes with `_vis<0.4`; red-triangle hidden when hardLock unseen; HUD foe-bar tracks
  the visible locked/soft target. `canSee(a,b)` = no cover box on the XZ segment (skips blocks both are above).
- **Bot vision** (`ai.js`): `seeNear/seeRange/seeCos` cone off `bot.aim` + `game.canSee`; 4s memory (`_mem`,`_ls`).
  Sees → attack; blind → **hunt toward last-seen (juke window) or the foe's area**, never attack. Keeps bots lethal but
  juke-able. ⚠️ needed `damp` imported in game.js.

## AI, targeting & 3D aim
- **AI styles** (`ai.js`, profiles in `characters.js → ai:{style,range,aggro,fly}`): rusher/beamer/artillery/zoner/
  bruiser/trickster/grappler/summoner. `pick()` chooses abilities by style+range; reactive: transform-when-low,
  phase/blink-escape, grapplers grab (via controlBot melee), summoners kite. Bots **fly up** at airborne foes
  (`out.fly` from height delta × `flyTend`). `intent()` returns `{move,aimDir,slots,fly,target}`.
- **3D aim** (`Fighter.aim3`): attacks angle up/down to the target's height. Beams (`BeamHose.dir` 3D, `lerp`-steer,
  3D segment-distance damage), projectiles/volley/charge use `aim3`. Set in `controlPlayer`/`controlBot`.
- **Hard-lock targeting**: click a foe → `game.hardLock` (red-triangle sprite, `_buildLockMark`); **facing follows the
  lock, aim3 follows the mouse** (decoupled). `T` clears. Gold reticle = mouse soft-target (shows where attacks go).
  Reset `hardLock` in `startMatch`.

## Beam battles & ki budget
- **Clash** (`projectiles._beamClash`): opposing sustaining beams that face each other form a struggle point;
  `_clashT` slides toward the weaker (weakness = `beam.clashPower()` = `might × powerBuff × (0.35+0.65·ki/maxKi)`).
  At t≤0.06 / ≥0.94 the loser is **overpowered** (`_overpower`: big explosion + heavy hit). Beams pin their tip at
  the clash via `clashLen`. Both burn extra ki while clashing.
- `beam.might` set in `spawnBeamFor` = `(def.might||dps/50) × charge × caster.def.beamMight`. `beamMight` on
  SOL/KANO/VEGA/NOVA/APEX (shown as "Beam Master" tag). Base ki regen lowered to 9/s so beams are a real budget.
- Beams pass `{src, dot}` so **Guard blocks them** (50%, slow guard-meter drain) and they shove physically.
- AI (`controlBot`): `incomingBeam`/`incomingProjectile` → **guard**, or **counter-beam** (`_forceBeam` holds a beam
  slot → creates a clash). ⚠️ AI reaction fields (`_forceBeamT` etc.) MUST init to 0 in the Fighter ctor — the logic
  compares `<= 0`; undefined breaks it. Arena is now **175** (`world.ARENA`) with extra cover.

## Ragdoll, models & combat UI (Goal 9)
- **Ragdoll** (`engine/ragdoll.js`): on `_ko()` a fighter becomes a **verlet ragdoll** — 15 point-masses at the
  joints (head/chest/pelvis, 2-seg arms, **2-seg legs with a knee**: hip→knee→foot), distance-constraint bones, gravity (`-62`, matches world),
  ground + cover collision, per-joint ground radius (`GROUND_R`), settle-to-**sleep**. Launch impulse = the killing
  blow's `this.vel` + a pop + a somersault spin. **Integration trick (no reparenting):** during ragdoll the arm/leg
  **pivots are zeroed** so their child capsules live in the root group's local space; with `g.rotation=0`, a mesh's
  local transform = world − `g.position`, so every limb is driven in world space directly. `apply()` drives the meshes;
  `restore()` puts the exact snapshotted transforms back on respawn (`_updateKO`). `game.handleKO` adds KO slowmo +
  banner. ⚠️ **rig contract**: arms index `arm.children[0..2]`=upper/fore/fist; **legs expose parts by name on
  `legL/R.userData` = {thigh, knee(group), shin, boot}** (the ragdoll zeros the knee groups too). New model details
  must mount on the DRIVEN meshes (head/torso/arm/thigh/shin), never as extra pivot children.
- **Models** (`figure(def)` in `entity.js`, flourishes in `BUILDS` keyed by id): better anatomy (neck, deltoids,
  jaw, faceted glove-fists, **two-bone legs with a knee** — hip cap + kneecap + boot/toe), a soft **contact-shadow** disc (`parts.shadow`, driven each frame — sinks/
  fades with altitude), and per-hero silhouette flair — **helmet/visor/crest/pauldrons(×1-2)/gauntlets/collar/headband/
  belt** — all mounted on driven meshes so the ragdoll carries them for free. NO PURPLE (accents are each hero's palette).
- **Combat UI** (`hud.js`): **radar/minimap** (`updateRadar`, top-right canvas — arena + cover + gold player marker +
  vision wedge + red foe dots + fog "?" at `_lastKnown`; hidden when `!(g.mode && g.running)`); **hit-direction** red
  edge arcs (`hitDirection(srcPos)`, fired from `game.onHit` when a human is struck); **low-HP danger** pulse (red
  vignette < 28% HP); **KO banner** (`showKO`, big gold "K.O."/"DOWN" + name, from `game.handleKO`). Ability chips keep
  the `.cd` height-fill cooldown overlay.

## Rendering & performance
- **Pipeline** (`world.js`): `EffectComposer` on an **HDR** RT (`HalfFloatType`, MSAA `samples:2`) → `RenderPass` →
  `UnrealBloomPass` → `OutputPass` (ACESFilmic tone-map, `exposure 1.28`). Renderer AA is **off** (`antialias:false`) —
  the composer RT does the MSAA, so canvas AA was pure waste. `stencil:false`. Pixel-ratio capped at `min(dpr, 2)`.
- **Bloom is half-resolution**: `UnrealBloomPass(new Vector2(w*0.5, h*0.5), 0.66, 0.6, 0.8)`; `resize`/`_applyQuality`
  keep it at half the RT size. Bloom is the priciest pass — half-res is ~4× cheaper for a look you can't tell apart.
- **Adaptive quality** (`render()`): frame-time EMA (`_ema`) drives 3 tiers — `_ema>24ms` drops a tier, `<13.5ms` raises.
  Tier sets pixelRatio (t2 = maxPR, t1 = 1.0, t0 = 0.72) **and** bloom strength. So it degrades gracefully on weak GPUs
  and stays crisp on strong ones (RTX 4090 → tier 2, ~2ms/full-render, locked 60). `get fps` for HUD/telemetry.
  ⚠️ In a **headless/backgrounded** tab, RAF throttles to ~10fps → EMA reads ~98ms even though a sync `composer.render()`
  is ~2ms. That is a compositor artifact, NOT the pipeline; measure real perf in a foregrounded tab (in-app pane = 60).
- **Lighting**: hemi (sky `#bcd4ff` / ground `#43352a`) + soft ambient + warm key **sun** + a cool back-**rim** light
  (`#8fb8ff`, so figures separate from the dark floor) + a warm fill kicker. Characters read as lit volumes, not flat.
- **Environment**: gradient **sky dome** (`_buildSky`, BackSide shader, dark zenith → warm horizon glow, `renderOrder -1`);
  richer ground (`_gridTexture`: checker + soft grid lines + tech corner ticks, `anisotropy 8`); a gold **center glow**
  (`_radialTex` additive `CircleGeometry`) grounds the arena; `FogExp2` haze + a CSS **vignette** (`hud.js`) frame it.
  ⚠️ Robert's early feedback was **"too dark"** — the vignette only darkens the corners; keep the action area bright.

## Status
Engine + roster + melee complete & verified: **14 kits** all fire without error; live AI combat, beams,
Big Bang shockwave+lightning, spirit bombs, teleport, summons, cursor constructs, flight, **the Strike/
Guard/Grab trifecta (with teleport-escape, energy-phase, thorns, absorb-throws)**, soft lock-on reticle,
floating damage numbers, combo counter, guard meter, pause — all working. Scene brightened; beam blobs tamed.
**Visual overhaul + optimization** (Goal 8): HDR half-float composer, half-res bloom, adaptive resolution, rim
lighting, gradient sky dome, gold center glow, richer ground, vignette, tuned tone-mapping — richer AND faster
(no wasted canvas AA, ~2ms/full-render on a 4090, 60fps).
**Ragdoll + models + combat UI** (Goal 9): verlet ragdoll on KO (tumbles, settles flat & natural, respects fog,
sleeps), upgraded per-hero models (helmets/visors/crests/pauldrons/gauntlets/capes + contact shadows), and a
gamified HUD (radar/minimap, KO banner + slowmo, hit-direction arcs, low-HP danger pulse).
**Knees + flight** (Goal 10): two-bone legs with a real **knee** (bends in the run cycle ~68°, snaps straight on kicks,
crouches on hard landings, and bends in the ragdoll); **fixed flight** into a proper levitation model — hold SPACE to
rise, release to **hover** (gentle bob, no coast), CTRL to descend, clean auto-land; flying pose leans + trails the legs.
Re-verified: all 14 kits fire, all 4 modes run, ragdolls (with knees) fire in live combat, flight rises/hovers/lands,
0 console errors, ~5.4ms/frame.
**Combat identity** (Goal 13): charged melee (jab/straight/HAYMAKER + guard crush + punishable jabs),
Overdrive comeback attribute (drained fists refill ki, HUD "⚡ OVERDRIVE" window), guard TYPES with a
visible guard arc (deflect bounces bullets back — Superman-vs-Punisher; barrier blocks 360° on ki),
Strength stat (kb resist / melee scale / ice break-outs), freeze-encase state, DoT stacks, KIVULI
(Ugandan gas controller — crimson-rose per the no-purple rule; hexes flippable) + GALE (archer,
draw-scaled real arrows, poison/flame/explosive quiver), grass (2400 instanced blades that burn away
under craters/scorch and restore on reset), LeFevre threat badges + Strength on select, guard on
C/X/Mouse4-5, 4 design docs. Verified: 20 kits error-free, every mechanic unit-tested, 60s 7-fighter
soak clean, sim 0.64ms.
**Creative expansion** (Goal 12): slam physics (wall/ground/border damage when launched — never self-inflicted),
KRAKEN (verlet tentacle grappler: seize → drag → wall-slam), RIFT (Portal-style orange/blue door pairs that
teleport fighters AND projectiles), TITAN (metal robot: pulse rifle, twin cannon, spark-on-hit, thruster exhaust),
SARGE (human arsenal: auto carbine, hand cannon, plasma blade, riot shield guard, frag grenades, Combat Leap,
Airstrike), VOLT reworked into a true speedster (Mach Sprint ghosts through cover w/ blue lightning wake, 12-hit
flurry), Will Fist grab→hoist→pile-drive, visible power tiers (aura color ladder + widening HUD meters + TIER
announcements), arena 175→240 with far-field cover. Verified: 18 kits error-free, all new mechanics unit-tested
headless, 45s mixed-roster soak clean.
**Evade + energy clarity + perf pass** (Goal 11): per-hero double-tap evade (dash/blink/sprint/slide/phase, data-driven,
bots juke with it too); loud drained/denied energy feedback (see Energy clarity above) — fixed the silent beam-death and
frozen-orb-when-dry bugs; perf issues #1–#3, #5–#10 closed (particle upload range + pool shrink, shared projectile/beam/orb
geometry, camera-following 110-unit shadow frustum, hidden crack overlays, alloc-free control/lightning/screenToGround,
dirty-checked HUD widgets, 25Hz radar, shader prewarm, no getComputedStyle in the loop). Sim CPU −77%, HUD −84%.
Re-verified: 14 kits × all slots error-free, 45s AI-vs-AI soak clean, double-tap works through real key events.

**ORIGIN character creator** (Goal 14): the D&D-for-superheroes payoff. Point-buy budgets (STREET→COSMIC
+ UNBOUND), attributes on the rank ladder deriving real engine stats, ~40 engine-proven powers with LIVE
damage numbers on every pick, gifts/talents/gadgets/frames/palettes/voice, auto-computed LeFevre threat,
SAVE & TEST straight into training. Customs persist in localStorage and are full roster citizens (playable,
rivals, survival waves, P2) with kit-derived AI doctrine. Verified headless end-to-end: API + real-click UI
drive, every slot fired error-free on a custom kit, save/reload/delete clean, STREET-vs-COSMIC duel stayed
honestly lopsided, production build passes, sim still 0.64ms/frame.

## Next / open
- Models are now upgraded procedural figures with per-hero flourishes (`figure()`/`BUILDS`) + ragdoll; GLTF still an
  option later but the offline procedural path is the product default. Versus mode. Ring-out KOs. Netcode (LAN-ready).
- Number keys only reach heroes 1–10; TORCH/APEX/SPECTER/VANGUARD are TAB-only for now.
- Ragdoll tuning knobs live in `ragdoll.js` (masses in `REST`, brace stiffness in `BONES`, `GROUND_R`, sleep threshold).
